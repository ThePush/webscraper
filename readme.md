# HTML scraper

A simple tool to gather informations from websites.

To configure it you need to look for the tag and/or class of the informations needed in the source code of the targeted page.

In this example the ```html_scraper``` script will create a csv file that contains the titles and descriptions of articles from a news website.

```csv_reader``` will display the csv file in the terminal.

```shell
#run
python3 html_scraper.py

#run
python3 csv_reader.py
```
